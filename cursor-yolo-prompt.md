# Project: Ableton Copilot (MCP + OSC + Voice + Max for Live)
# Goal: Voice-activated Ableton assistant launched via Max for Live, with MCP tool APIs, OSC bridge, voice daemon, and Next.js web UI.

# ==== CONTEXT ====
- Root repo name: ableton-copilot
- Structure: monorepo with Python apps (mcp-server, osc-bridge, voice-daemon), Next.js web-ui, optional Tauri desktop launcher, and a Max for Live .amxd device with Node for Max helper.
- Communication flow: MCP tools -> JSON -> osc-bridge -> OSC messages -> Ableton Live (via AbletonOSC control surface).
- Voice flow: wake word + STT -> transcript -> MCP tool invocation.
- Web UI: shows transcript, tool invocations, OSC log, and track/scene graph.
- All configs & scaffolding defined in `stack.yml`.

.env.example         # API keys and ports

# ==== REQUIREMENTS ====
1. Generate minimal working code for all entrypoints listed above (FastAPI apps, OSC bridge, MCP tool stub, voice daemon loop, Node for Max boot.js).
2. Implement contracts from stack.yml:
   - `/osc` POST route in osc-bridge maps JSON cmd -> OSC addr.
   - MCP tool example (bpm.set) forwards to osc-bridge.
   - Voice daemon loop simulates wake word, transcribes, posts to MCP.
   - Node for Max boot script spawns services & opens web UI.
3. Scaffold web-ui with Next.js + Tailwind + Socket.IO (placeholder dashboard).
4. Use environment variables from .env.example (`OSC_HOST`, `OSC_PORT_OUT`, `OSC_PORT_IN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.).
5. Provide `requirements.txt` per Python app, `package.json` in web-ui, and a Docker Compose for Redis + services.
6. Ensure README.md contains install/run instructions (dev mode and M4L boot mode).
7. Follow the run graph in stack.yml for service startup order.

# ==== STYLE ====
- Keep code minimal but runnable.
- Include inline comments that explain key parts.
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness.
- Assume developer is using Cursor to fill in details iteratively.

# ==== TASK ====
ðŸ‘‰ Scaffold this repo end-to-end in YOLO mode using the above context. Create all stub files with minimal code and reference `stack.yml` as the source of truth.
